# âš½ BallTracker Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
This project aims to **detect and track football players, referees, and the ball** in match videos using **YOLO**, one of the leading object detection models. The system enhances detection accuracy through training and assigns players to teams based on **t-shirt color clustering via KMeans**.

Key features include:
- Team identification using **KMeans clustering** on pixel data.
- **Ball possession analytics** by tracking which team controls the ball.
- **Optical Flow** to measure **camera movement** across frames.
- **Perspective transformation** to calculate movement in **real-world units (meters)**.
- **Speed and distance tracking** for individual players.

This project showcases a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques, making it valuable for both beginners and experienced engineers.
